                Executive Briefing
                ===================
                Opportunities:
                - Sustainability positioning resonates with enterprise RFP criteria.
                - AI-enabled optimisation reduces fulfilment cost by 18% in pilots.
                Risks:
                - Capital expenditure remains a barrier for mid-market prospects.
                - Integration complexity demands stronger SI partnerships.
                Recommended watch-outs: monitor interoperability roadmap and quantify carbon savings.
